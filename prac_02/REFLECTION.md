# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched 100% of the lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch the lectures at home in the morning (around 9 a.m.).

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am getting more comfortable to tools like PyCharm, Git, GitHub. These tools are really useful for developers, so I
will keep exploring and slowly master them.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Sometimes I find myself a bit careless, which slow me down a lot instead of speeding things up. I need to stop this.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Sometimes I accidentally repeat myself. I need to change in order to write cleaner code.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

One thing that makes me happy when doing practicals is that I am able to apply different principals (for example, SRP, 
DRY) and programming patterns (for instance, menu pattern, decision structures) into each part of the program.
