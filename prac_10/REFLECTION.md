# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy usually be around 85%.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

After making mistakes estimating my time of finishing the practicals, I calculated the average actual time. From that
average time, I am managed to estimate more correctly.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Estimating time is also a problem. And I am happy that I was able to come up with a solution which is calculating the
average time. This helped me learn more about problem-solving, which is an essential skill to be a better developer.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that convention is extremely important, especially when working in a group, organization. Following the
convention well would help my colleagues understand my code easier in order to give me more accurate feedback. When I
received compliments about my code, I am happy that they were able to understand what my code is doing.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned from people's mistake. Things like bad naming, repeating code. Though, they are valuable lessons, which remind
me not to make those mistakes and be a better programmer.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review for practical 06 from @kyaesinmoehtet](https://github.com/kyaesinmoehtet/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

In the code review, I repeatedly remind my peer to add a docstring for each method. I also suggested some good modules
that he can use such as the `datetime` module. I reminded him to avoid "magic number" and use constant instead.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review for practical 05 from @kyaesinmoehtet](https://github.com/kyaesinmoehtet/cp1404practicals/pull/1#pullrequestreview-2653100009)

### Explanation

In this code review, I carefully instruct my peer to follow good programming patterns. Such as telling him to put the
main() function on the top of the code, suggesting better variable names.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would remove some parts which are unnecessarily long. Instead, I would focus more on practicing following good
convention and problem-solving.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I followed good convention. I wrote much cleaner code than I used to. My code is now more organized than ever. I now
feel much more confident when sharing my code and explaining how it works to others.
