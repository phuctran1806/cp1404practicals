# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I learnt to make small milestones for every process by making small git commit after completing each step in the exercises.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my time better. Sometimes I feel like I spend too much time on one particular task in the practical.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I write much cleaner code, which help me check my work more easily and finish the practicals much faster.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to be more careful when doing my work so that I do not have to re-check it so many times.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think teachers should encourage students to start working on some kind of small projects.
