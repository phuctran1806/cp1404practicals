# CP1404 Practicals

## About myself
I am Phuc, from Vietnam. I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology. Programming is one of my favourite subjects.

## About the repo
This repository contains all of my Python practicals from week 1 to 10.

## Lessons that I've learned about "clean code"
- Cleaner code makes maintenance easier.
- Following conventions like good naming, consistent formatting is the key to clean code.
- Simplicity is also key, don't make the code too complex.
